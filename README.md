* hero [graphics](https://www.ls.graphics/illustrations/bzzzt) (you need to provide your e-mail address to download)
  * hit `Submit` and `Complete` and `Confirm` (or in different order) and some other next buttons to get an info your link has been sent to your mailbox
  * in this case `.zip` file is 410MB
  * I downloaded whole archieve however I needed only one `.svg` file (`#03.svg`), I just opened downloaded archieve (without extracting), found required file and (with right-mouse-click) copied to Desktop, remaining part of archive has been removed from local disc drive
* Google [logo](https://pixabay.com/pl/vectors/google-logo-cie%C5%84-1088004/) in `1260x1280` version (`.png`), this is with some shadow integrated
* Facebook [logo](https://www.flaticon.com/search?word=facebook&type=icon&license=selection&order_by=4), `Free` tab should be chosen, I downloaded `.png` in default version (`512x512`) and added some shadow to match Google logo (which has shadow integrated)
